## University of Michigan -  Python for Everybody Specialization(Coursera)

### Mode: Online

This was the first course I took online that intorduced me into the world of computer science. Mr. Severance showed great proficiency and even made programming newbies pretty comfortable with the course. It is a specialization I will highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn how to program and have a strong foundation in Python.

### Description
This Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, youâ€™ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own  applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.

### Courses

> Course 1 - Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
>> This course taught me the basics of programming computers using Python. At the end of this course, I covered the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.

> Course 2 - Python Data Structures
>> The course introduced me to the core data structures of the Python programming language. I explored how to use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. 

> Course 3 - Using Python to Access Web Data
>> This course will introduced me to how to source data from the internet.I scraped, parsed, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs. I also worked with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python. 

> Course 4 - Using Databases with Python
>> This course introduced me to the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as basic database design for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort. I used SQLite3 as the database and also built web crawlers and multi-step data gathering and visualization processes. Finally, I used the D3.js library to do basic data visualization.

> Course 5 - Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python
>> In this capstone, I built a series of applications to retrieve, process and visualize data using Python. In the first part of the capstone, I did some visualizations to become familiar with the technologies in use and then pursued my own project to visualize some other data that I had found.
